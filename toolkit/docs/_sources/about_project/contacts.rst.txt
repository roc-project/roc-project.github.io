Chat
====

We also have a Matrix room for more interactive discussion: ``#roc-streaming:matrix.org``.

You can connect via Element (Matrix client) by following `this link <https://app.element.io/#/room/#roc-streaming:matrix.org>`_. You can also `install Element <https://element.io/get-started>`_ to desktop or mobile device.

.. note::

   The formerly used IRC channel ``#rocstreaming`` at freenode is abandoned. Archives are `here <https://freenode.logbot.info/rocstreaming/>`_.

Except Element, there are plenty of other `Matrix clients <https://matrix.org/clients/>`_.
